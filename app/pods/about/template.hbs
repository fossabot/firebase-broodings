<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<h4 id="me">Me</h4>
<p>I'm a twenty-something, pseudo under-graduate, above average sized cog in a corporate machine.</p>
<p>Also a workaholic who was bored during his days off and saw the need to do something else. Hence this blog.</p>
<h4 id="the-blog">The Blog</h4>
<p>This blog is as much an exercise in webapp development and social psychology as it is in blogging.</p>
<p>While I'll try to shine a ray of sunlight when possible, the title should give you a pretty good idea as to the general tone of the blog.</p>
<p>Any comments/suggestions are mostly welcome.</p>
